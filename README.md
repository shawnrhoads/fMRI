# misc_brain contains scripts for fMRI/DTI preprocessing and analysis

./fMRI_artifactDetection contains two scripts for recursively generating configuration settings per subject in study and running ART toolbox

./probTractography contains script to recursively pre-process diffusion tensor imaging data and run probabilistic tractography analysis. 
Script can use two methods:
    1) To generate a NxN connectivity matrix;
    2) To run a seed2target analysis

masterFDT_parallel.sh runs subjects in parallel
